# remote-admin-tool
Simple remote administration tool for Linux and Android. This project is intended for personal use
not intended for spying other people, but rather I am spying myself. This is intended to be installed
in my local machines and my phones so that I have bird's eye view in all of my devices. Since this is
published here in Github, feel free to fork this project and use it on whatever purpose you may like
it.

With great power comes with great responsibiility. If you choose to be evil, be ready for the consequences.
