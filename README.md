# remote-admin-tool
Simple remote administration tool for Linux. This project is intended for personal use not intended
to be installed in my local machines including my phone so that I have bird's eye view in all of my
devices. Since this is published here in Github, feel free to fork this project and use it on
whatever purpose you may like it.

With great power comes with great responsibiility. Don't be evil.
