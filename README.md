# remote-admin-tool
Simple remote administration tool for Linux and Android. This project is intended for personal use
not intended for spying other people, but rather I am spying myself. This is intended to be installed
in my local machines and my phones so that I have bird's eye view in all of my devices. Since this is
published here in Github, feel free to fork this project and use it on whatever purpose you may like
it.

With great power comes with great responsibiility. If you choose to be evil, be ready for the consequences.

There are lots of RATs out there, but I can't trust other's work as from the name itself, it has an evil
connotation and is heavily related to malware. I can't compromise my own security by trusting others,
thus I built it myself. Same goes for you. Don't trust me. Check the code and see the program for yourself
then decide whether this fits your need and this can be trusted.
